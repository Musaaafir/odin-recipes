    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mostaccioli is a hearty baked pasta that's perfect for a weeknight dinner. Essentially an easier lasagna made with penne. Top it with plenty of cheese and you'll soon have a new favorite to add to the rotation. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb. sweet italian sausage, remove from casing</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
        <li>1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li> 
        <li>1 (28-oz.) can whole peeled tomatoes, pulsed in a blender</li> 
        <li>1 sprig of fresh basil, plus more chopped for garnish</li> 
        <li>Kosher salt</li> 
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li> 
        <li>8 oz. Penne pasta</li>  
        <li>1 large egg</li> 
        <li>1 c. ricotta</li> 
        <li>1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesan, divided</li> 
        <li>1 1/2 c. shredded mozzarella, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450°. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat oil. Add sausage and cook, breaking up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until golden, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes to sausage and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomatoes and basil and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally until sauce is thickened slightly, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta until al dente, about 2 minutes less than package instructions; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, lightly beat egg. Stir in ricotta, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and ½ cup mozzarella into the egg. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce in a 2-quart baking dish. Arrange penne on top of tomato sauce in an even layer and dollop with ricotta mixture and remaining sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan and remaining 1 cup mozzarella.</li> 
        <li>Bake mostaccioli until top is deeply golden and sauce is bubbling, about 15 minutes. Garnish with basil before serving.</li>
